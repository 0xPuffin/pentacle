It is distinguished from other DEX protocols by its automated market maker, which lets people deposit liquidity in a single-sided fashion, whereas many other platforms require its visitors to provide liquidity with their tokens in an inherently two-sided way. Bancor's automated market maker mechanism achieves this through its native token, BNT, which is dynamically minted and co-invested by the protocol when visitors deposit their collateral as liquidity. Besides having BNT as the unitary counterpart asset of exchange for trading on the platform, the protocol also offers a unique solution against Impermanent Loss to its liquidity providers.",

Visitors can for example deposit their DAI into the protocol, and receive (a lesser amount of) alUSD tokens, equally pegged to $1. The protocol uses the collateral provided by its visitors to collect yield and dynamically repay the depositors' debt, essentially giving its users an immediate claim on the future yield of their tokens. The protocols native token is ALCX, used to govern the development and directional decisions of Alchemix.",

It is distinguished from other DEX protocols by its automated market maker, which lets people deposit liquidity in a single-sided fashion, whereas many other platforms require its visitors to provide liquidity with their tokens in an inherently two-sided way. Bancor's automated market maker mechanism achieves this through its native token, BNT, which is dynamically minted and co-invested by the protocol when visitors deposit their collateral as liquidity. Besides having BNT as the unitary counterpart asset of exchange for trading on the platform, the protocol also offers a unique solution against Impermanent Loss to its liquidity providers.",
