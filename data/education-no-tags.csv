0,amm,"Traditional digital markets, like the NASDAQ stock exchange (as well as centralized crypto exchanges) work with matching engines built for so-called Limit Order Books: buyers and sellers have to offer up their goods at a certain price in a certain quantity, and wait to be matched with someone else to conduct a trade. This may sound simple in principle, but these orderbooks are a very competitive landscape where professional market makers compete with each other at split second speeds — it has been practically impossible to replicate this model on today's decentralized blockchains such as Ethereum.","Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are mathematical functions that make it possible for people to trade their coins on Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in a transparent way on the blockchain, without trusted intermediaries. Continuing with the comparison, they are a replacement for the matching engine used on traditional marketplaces, while the order books are replaced with so-called Liquidity Pools — kept in balance by the aforementioned AMM.","Code bugs/exploits (unintended, many new and untested AMM algorithms). Scam coins / rugpulls — the market owner on e.g. coinbase makes sure only ""legit"" coins are available on their platform; not the case on permissionless DEXes...","Exchange without trusted intermediaries. Sometimes the DEX protocols have their own coin which they give out as a reward to their users (as an airdrop or in form of yield for LPing, for example)"
1,divergence loss,"The loss produced by giving your coins to an AMM to manage instead of just holding them, if they diverge in price..",DL is a risk that one is exposed to when providing liquidity on an AMM.,"Protocols typically give out rewards/yield to counterbalance this danger, which often, but not always makes up for the divergence loss suffered.",
2,hold,"Starting with Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have introduced a truly novel form of money (and more) to the world. The thing which unites and makes this asset class special is the technology referred to as **blockchain**; a set of algorithms and rules that constitute a distributed digital network where each participant (e.g. holder of a cryptocurrency) can be sure that their balances are correct and accessible — without trusting a central intermediary, like a bank. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency today, proved that blockchains are useful for more than just simple money transfers; it allows people to build decentralized apps, which, in less than a decade, has resulted in an explosion of Decentralized Financial (DeFi) protocols, and tokens of all kind, including NFTs. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies today with many created each day — it is important to understand the purpose and background of a token before buying it.","Bitcoin is the first trustless internet-native currency. Since its blockchain ledger is distributed and open, anyone is free to use it, as well as able to verify that its rules are maintained and noone is spending more than they ought to be able. This is different from ""regular"" online money transactions, made with e.g. Visa or PayPal, where the service provider can potentially shut you out if they feel like it, or are told to by a government. BTC in particular is commonly referred to as digital gold, and many people have used it as shelter from inflation in e.g. Turkey or Venezuela. Other cryptoassets can have different use-cases; Ether, for example, is needed to run the various dApps built on the Ethereum network.","As a nascent asset class, cryptocurrencies are infamous for their high volatility. Even though early investors in today's biggest cryptocurrencies have gained generously over time, it is easy for the faint of heart to panic sell when prices are dropping sharply; it's important to understand what we're holding in order to have conviction in times like those. As mentioned, the premise of cryptocurrencies in general is the removal of trusted intermediaries, and distributing the responsibilites which belonged to them in traditional financial systems over the whole network. This is a double-edged sword, however — there is no customer support to revert your transaction if you send your coins to the wrong place.","Cryptocurrencies backed by blockchain technologies have various benefits over fiat money. Some people buy them as investment or saving vehicles, speculating that their value is going to increase in the future. Others may turn to them because traditional banks are unreliable or less convenient than cryptocurrencies. A traditional wire transfer between countries, for example, can take several days or more. Blockchain-native stablecoins allow people to do similar value transactions within a few minutes, without the added risk of price instability."
3,provide liquidity,"Liquidity is basically the abundance of a coin in the market. DEXes typically rely on liquidity pools, managed by AMMs, as opposed to the Limit Order Book system prevalent in centralized digital exchanges where professional market makers sell and buy from people with proprietary algorithms.","If you create your own coin, you need to have a market for it so people can get it; it's not easy to get listed on a CEX... DeFi protocols often give incentives for providing liquidity in form of yield.","If the coins' prices change, Divergence Loss can occur. This is much less likely for LPing various stablecoins, where one can be fairly certain they will stay the same price.",
4,stake,"Staking crypto essentially means locking it up for future rewards — much like a savings account. The complexity of staking one's crypto, as well as the risks and rewards can vary depending on the coin and the place where it is staked. Bitcoin's blockchain relies on a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work, where the validity of the network is maintained by having people use their computers for solving math problems, roughly speaking. Proof of Stake is an alternative consensus mechanism that aims to alleviate the computational burden from a blockchain network via having people put their coins on the line instead. PoS networks include Solana, Avalanche and ETH2.0, amongst others. In DeFi applications built on top of these blockchains, staking coins has been used for incentivising people to provide liquidity or partake in governance, for example.","Depends on the protocol; most often you stake your LP tokens to ""prove"" that you are committed to providing liquidity, in exchange for yield rewards. Proof of Stake L1s need it for network security...",Staking contract can be buggy or intentionally exploitable/drainable,
